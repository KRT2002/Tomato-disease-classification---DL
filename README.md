# Tomato-disease-classification---DL
## Overview
The data set that has used in this project has taken from the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). This dataset contain images related to potato, pepper-bell as well as tomato disease in separate directories. The objective of this project is to classify the toamto based on their disease into 10 different catogories (directory name related to tomato dataset). 
I implemented this Tomato Disease Classification Deep Learning project by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Used the TensorFlow framework and integrated pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub. Applied fine-tuning techniques to optimize and enhance the performance of the pre-trained models, achieving notable accuracy.
## How to run?
### Step 1: Data installation
Install dataset from kaggle and extract only tomato dataset folder from this. The extracted dataset folder is stored in folder named as data. 
### Step 2: Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 3: Download the notebook and run
