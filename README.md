# Tomato-disease-classification---DL
## Overview
I executed the Tomato Disease Classification Deep Learning project, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow. The dataset, downloaded from Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village), comprised images of potato, pepper-bell, and tomato diseases in separate directories. The primary goal was to classify tomatoes based on ten distinct disease categories represented by directory names in the tomato dataset. Employing the TensorFlow framework, I integrated pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub and applied fine-tuning techniques to optimize and significantly enhance model performance, resulting in notable accuracy.
## How to run?
### Step 1: Data installation
Install dataset from kaggle and extract only tomato dataset folder from this. The extracted dataset folder is stored in folder named as data. 
### Step 2: Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 3: Download the notebook and run
